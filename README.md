*A new-found love for storytelling through data analysis and visualization*


👋Hi, I'm Samuel Laleye, a finance professional transitioning from a ten-year career in Accounting to Data Analytics, bringing with me a solid analytical foundation and a results-driven mindset. I have over ten years accounting experience working for a primary school and four years working in a food retail business.
😄I have an MSc in Finance and Investment from Durham University, where I developed a strong grounding in financial analysis and quantitative reasoning. 
🌱I recently completed a Data Technician Bootcamp organized by Just IT Training London, where I gained hands-on experience with Advanced Excel, Tableau, Power BI, Azure Data, SQL and Python.
💞️This unique combination of finance expertise and data analytics skills allows me to analyse data with both precision and insight into business needs. I’m excited to apply my attention to details, problem-solving, critical thinking, customer focused, collaborating abilities and a fresh data analytics toolkit to drive meaningful insights and support strategic decision-making. 
👀 My goal is to join a data team where I can leverage my background and new skills to uncover actionable insights that empower smarter business choices.
📫 You can reach me at slaleye7@gmail.com
🌍 I'm based in Manchester.
⚡Oh, did you know that Excel has over 400 functions and I’ve not even mastered 5% of them? But you’d be surprised by the amazing things I can do with the few functions I’ve mastered in Excel.
